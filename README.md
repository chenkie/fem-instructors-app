# Front End Masters Instructors App

## What's This?

This is the front end app that accompanies the [Hapi.js API](https://github.com/chenkie/fem-instructors-api) which gets built in my Getting Started with Hapi.js workshop at [Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/). It provides a simple UI for fetching a list of instructors, drilling into the details of a single instructor, and also adding a new instructor.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenkie/fem-instructors-app.git
```

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed and then install the Angular CLI.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Install the dependencies for the application.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app using the Angular CLI.

```bash
ng serve
```

The app will be served at `http://localhost:4200`.
